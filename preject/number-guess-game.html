    Guess a number between 1 and 100:
    <input id="userguess" type="number" min="1" max="100" value="0">
    <button onclick="guess(document.getElementById('userguess').valueAsNumber ?? 0)">Guess</button>
    <div id="output"></div>

    <script>
        // This is the number the user has to guess. It's
        // a random number between 1 and 100
        let secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

        // finish the "guess" function. This function is called
        // whenever the user makes a new guess.
        // you can use the "output" function to tell the user
        // whether their guess was too high, low, or whether
        // they guessed the correct number.
        // BONUS1: When the user guessed right, tell them how
        // often they had to guess to get the right number
        // BONUS2: After 4 guesses, give the user a hint.
        // The hint consists of the largest number they guessed
        // below the secret number and the smallest number they guessed
        // above the secret number.
        // Example: The secret number is 50, the user guessed
        // 25, 3, 99, 10, 51. The hint should say:
        // "The secret number is between 25 and 51".
        function guess(userGuess) {
            console.log("the user guessed: " + userGuess);

            output("TODO");
        }
    </script>

    <script>
        // Call this function to display a text on the web page
