/*
    You work as a developer at an online bookstore.
    The sales team sent you some data regarding the sales of the last 4 months and you have to prepare a report for the web.
    Instructions:
    - all the variables provided are set to 0, so in order to check that your code works you have to change them to different values
    - if you think you need additional variables, feel free to create them
    - some variables must be used in more than one exercise
    - every exercise mentions if...else statement, but in some cases you might need to use also the "else if"
*/

let sales = 0;

/*
    Exercise 1:
    You want to check that the total sales are within a certain range.
    - complete the if...else statement so that the result is true if sales are greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to 99
*/

if () {
  console.log("Sales are: " + sales + ". Are they between 70 and 99?", true);
} else {
  console.log("Sales are: " + sales + ". Are they between 70 and 99?", false);
}

/*
    Exercise 2:
    You receive a report with the sales from the Sci-fi department and the Crime department.
    You want to check that the sales of at least one of the two departments are within a certain range, otherwise it's bad news for the store
    - write an if...else statement that outputs true if at least one of the 2 sales amount is in the range between 200 and 500, false otherwise
    - test with different values
    */

let sciFiDepartmentSales = 0;
let crimeDepartmentSales = 0;

  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

/*
    Exercise 3:
    You also receive the report from the Comic Book department.
    Using also the variables from Exercise 2, check that at least one of the three departments sold enough.
    - write an if...else statement that outputs true if at least one of the 3 sales amount is in the range between 200 and 500, false otherwise
    - test with different values
