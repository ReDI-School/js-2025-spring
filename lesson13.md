### Recap

---

### Project: TODO list

Create an input element and a button.

When the user clicks the button, add the value from
the input element to an array.

Create a `render()` function that renders
all TODO items to a `div` element in your html page.

---

### Bonus

* Allow every TODO item only once. When the user enters something that's already in the array, ignore it.
* Render every other TODO item with a slightly different background so they become more readble.
Example: TODO item 1 (white background, TODO item 2 (light grey background), TODO item 3 (white background)....
* Add a button that reverses the order in the TODO list (e.g. oldest first). Hint: Use a `for` loop to iterate your array from back to front.
